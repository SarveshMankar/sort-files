# sort-files
## Sorts all the files in current directory.

 Usually we don't keep our Files properly in the sorted way.
 
 There are many images, videos, audio files, programming files, datasets in the same folder and to find a particular file becomes clumsy.
 
 Manually adjusting all the files is too tedious and people like me just want the things to be automated.
 
 So I have made a program that just sorts all the files.

> Putting the file in the required Folder

 If we want to sort the folder Downloads then just put the *sort_files.py* file in that Downloads folder.
 
 > To install the Libraries (Needed only Once)
 
 pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 > To Sort Files
 
 Running it by command *python sort_files.py* will sort all the things.
 
 And then you are good to go and finding the files is much easier.

> For any changes

 If I have missed out any file extension, so just go to the file *sort_files.py* and in *Part 2* just add the extension in the respective list.
 
 I tried my best to make the file readable and I'm sure it will be easy for you guys to add any extension in it.
 
 Running it will make the Work.
